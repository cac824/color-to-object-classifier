# color-to-object-classifier
This is my fourth personal project. It's a color detection system that I made using Python and OpenCV
It uses your camera for real-time color detection

**Features**
* Gets video frames from your camera
* Converts the frames into an HSV
* Shows the predefined colors (blue, green, and red) using a mask 

**Libraries**
* Opencv for camera use and color detection
* Numpy for color ranges

**Future Plans**
* I plan on making this into an object classifier gradually with OpenCV's library
* I plan on using AI to automatically detect what object it is and say what color and object it is
